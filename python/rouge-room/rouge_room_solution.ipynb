    "1. This assignment has two parts. The first part is to draw a room by writing multiple functions to do that. For example, the student will write a few functions to draw a line with player inside, a line of the top room and of the bottom of the room, and a line in the middle of the room without player. These are clearly not **member functions** of the class `Room`. That is, if the function name is `draw_one_line`, I cannot use the syntax `my_room.draw_one_line(...)`. Now, you need to implement all these functions as **member functions** so that we can call these functions from a `Room` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let us create a room with size $(13, 7)$ now, so the `width=13` and `height=7`. I do not want you to move the player by using the keyboard to input the letters. I want you to write code using `for` loops to move the player to the middle of the room. In other words, the player needs to move right $6$ times and move down $3$ times. You can use how many loops you need. I re-emphasize that you must do this by writing code.  \n",
    "   <u>**Answer**</u> The student only needs to write two loops, one loop is to move the player to the right $6$ times using `for _ in range(6)` and another loop is to move the player down $3$ times using `for _ in range(3)`.  \n",
    "   <u>**Time**</u>: We give the students roughly $5$ to $10$ minutes to do this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, you can see that the floor is marked by using the dot `.`. Of course, it is possible to use any markers we want to represent the floor marker. For example, we can use `x`, `o` or underscore `_`, etc.. I want you to change a small part of code you already wrote so that I can decide the marker when I initialize/create the Room. In other words, the following code should run  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   room = Room(13, 7, 'x')\n",
    "   room.draw()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   or the following code should do the same job but with the floor marked by `o`\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   room = Room(13, 7, 'o')\n",
    "   room.draw()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Then, the floor is now marked by `x`. I re-emphasize that you only need to modify your code very slightly.  \n",
    "   <u>**Answer**</u> The student needs to modify the constructor defined by the function `__init__(self, width, height)`. Particularly, they need to add the attribute `floor_marker` to the object through the assignment `self.floor_marker = floor_marker`. Then, they need to change the marker `'.'` in their code to `self.floor_marker`. These steps should solve the question. They can use any way they need, but this is the easiest way to go.  \n",
    "   <u>**Time**</u>: We give the students roughly $5$ to $10$ minutes to do this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. This question is a continuation of question $2$ above. You need to slightly to change your code to make both following constructors work:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   room = Room(13, 7)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   and \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   room = Room(13, 7, 'x')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   In the first case when no marker is defined in the constructor, the floor marker `'.'` will be used. In the second case when the marker is specifically defined, that marker will be used.  \n",
    "   <u>**Anser**</u> The student needs to modify the constructor defined by the function `__init__(self, width, height, floor_marker)` so that `floor_marker` receives default value. The the modification is very minimal:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def __init__(self, width, height, floor_marker='.')\n",
    "\n",
    "5. When the player reaches the wall, further moving against the wall will not let the player to move. In this question, I want you to move the player so that they get back to the position against the opposite wall. For example,\n",
